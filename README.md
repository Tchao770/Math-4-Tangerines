## Introduction
Offer a straightforward platform for parents and guardians to customize and create a range of math problems for their child. This web application will enable user to create math problems with ease, along with results.

## Motivating Use Cases
It can be time consuming to write out math problems repeatedly on a piece of paper, in addition to having to check each problem for correctness. You also don't want to waste precious ink on paper to print out a set of math problems for kids, only to throw it away after use, wasting paper and ink.

Many platforms that offer math practice tend to be convoluted and difficult to navigate. The goal is to make math more engaging by adding various themes to a platform, but they can distract the user from focusing on the problems.

## Proposed Solution
Allow user to create custom math problem sets that can be generated, given a range, number of problems, and mathematic functions.

Upon each generation, there will also be an answer key generated along with the given problem set, to allow for ease of checking and assessment.

An elapsed timer to gauge users performance and speed when solving problems.
